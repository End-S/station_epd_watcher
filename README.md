# station_epd_watcher
Watch trains arriving and departing on an Inky pHAT display. Originally created for Emsworth station which has two platforms but 
could be easily be adapted. All you need is an API key from National Rail (https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/100296.aspx) and an image
of a station map.
